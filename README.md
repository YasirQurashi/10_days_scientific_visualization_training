# 10 Days Scientific Visualization Training (R)

## Overview

This repository documents my structured training and applied work in 
**publication-quality scientific visualization and statistical data analysis using R**.

The goal of this project is to develop and demonstrate expertise in:

- Journal-ready figure preparation
- Advanced statistical visualization
- Reproducible research workflows
- Multi-panel manuscript figure design
- Thesis and PhD-level data presentation standards

This repository serves as both:
1. A professional portfolio
2. A reproducible research archive

---

## Objectives

- Transform raw research data into publication-ready visualizations
- Apply statistical rigor to graphical representation
- Follow high-impact journal standards (Nature / Elsevier style formatting principles)
- Develop consultant-level workflow for academic collaboration

---

Each week focuses on a specific category of scientific visualization 
relevant to MPhil and PhD research applications.

## Visualization Standards Followed

- Clear axis labeling with scientific units
- Colorblind-friendly palettes
- Appropriate statistical summaries (mean ± SE, CI, effect size)
- Avoidance of misleading chart types
- High-resolution export (300–600 DPI TIFF)
- Multi-panel labeling (A, B, C, D) for manuscript submission

---

## Workflow

Each analysis follows a structured pipeline:

1. Data import & cleaning
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Statistical testing or modeling
4. Visualization development
5. Publication-quality refinement
6. Multi-panel figure assembly
7. Interpretation (results-style writing)
8. Export for journal submission

---

## Example Focus Areas

- Experimental design visualization (ANOVA, interaction effects)
- Regression and correlation modeling
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Clustering and heatmaps
- Time series trend analysis
- Spatial epidemiological mapping
- Mixed-effects models visualization
- Effect size and confidence interval plotting

---

## Reproducibility

All analyses are conducted using R Markdown.

To reproduce any report:

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the `.Rmd` file in RStudio
3. Install required packages
4. Knit to GitHub Document or HTML
